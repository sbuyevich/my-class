# My Class MVP Plan. Stage 2.

## Summary

Stage 2 improves the post-login experience and teacher student management. The app should no longer expose Login as a normal navigation item. Instead, unauthenticated users are gated by a login modal, and successful teacher or student login redirects to `/home`.

The Students page becomes a more useful teacher tool by adding name search and a confirmed remove action. Removing a student permanently deletes that student from the current class, which forces that student to register again before logging in.

Stage 2 also tracks whether students are active in the current classroom session. Student login marks the student active, and the teacher can reset all students in the current class to inactive from the Students page.

## Key Changes

- Replace navigation-based login with an unauthenticated gate:
  - remove the Login item from the navigation menu
  - show the login UI as a blocking MudBlazor modal/dialog when no login state exists
  - keep login state in `sessionStorage` under the existing key
  - redirect successful teacher and student logins to `/home`
- Keep student registration available from the login modal:
  - student can register when no matching `Student` record exists
  - successful registration stores `IsTeacher = false`
  - successful registration redirects to `/home`
- Enhance the teacher Students page:
  - add a search field above the grid
  - filter by first name, last name, and display name only
  - keep results scoped to the current class
  - add a row-level remove action
  - show a confirmation dialog before removing a student
  - hard-delete the selected student from the database
  - add a teacher-only Reset button that sets current-class students inactive
  - replace the Registered column with an `IsActive` column
- Track student active state:
  - add `Student.IsActive`
  - default new and existing students to inactive
  - set `IsActive = true` after successful student login
  - reset only students from the current class
- Keep teacher-only protections:
  - only teacher login state can view the Students page
  - student users and unsigned-in users see a clear unauthorized message or are blocked by the login modal
  - removal must validate teacher state and current class scope server-side

## Public Interfaces / Types

- Extend `IStudentService` with teacher-only methods for:
  - querying students by current class and optional name search text
  - removing a student by id from the current class
  - resetting current-class students to inactive
- Extend `Student` with `IsActive`.
- Add small result types only if needed to return success/failure messages for removal.
- Continue using existing `LoginState`, `IAuthService`, `ILoginStateService`, `ISessionStorageService`, and `ClassContext`.
- Do not add controllers, Minimal APIs, ASP.NET Core Identity, or external AJAX endpoints for this stage.

## Test Plan

- App opens to a login modal when no user is logged in.
- Navigation menu does not show a Login item.
- Teacher login with appsettings credentials stores teacher login state and redirects to `/home`.
- Student login stores student login state and redirects to `/home`.
- Student registration from the login modal still works and redirects to `/home`.
- Teacher can open `/students` and see only students from the current class.
- Student or unsigned-in users cannot use the Students page.
- Search filters students by first name, last name, and display name.
- Search does not match username unless it is also part of a displayed name.
- Remove action shows a confirmation dialog before deleting.
- Confirmed remove deletes the student from the database for the current class only.
- Removed student can no longer log in until registering again.
- Canceling remove leaves the student unchanged.
- Successful student login sets `IsActive = true`.
- Reset sets all current-class students to `IsActive = false`.
- Reset does not affect students from another class.
- Students grid shows `IsActive` and does not show Registered.
- `dotnet build .\MyClass.slnx` succeeds with no warnings or errors.

## Assumptions

- "Login page as modal form" means a blocking app-level modal shown whenever no valid login state exists.
- "No Login item in Navigation menu" means the nav link is removed entirely, not hidden only after login.
- Student removal is a hard delete, not a soft delete.
- Search is name-only: first name, last name, and display name.
- `IsActive` tracks classroom session activity and does not block login.
- Stage 2 keeps the current local classroom auth model and does not introduce ASP.NET Core Identity.
